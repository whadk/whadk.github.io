<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="How_I_want_to_debate_0"></a>Creativity</h5>
Creativity has been something I have thought about a lot and tried to read about a lot too. Creativity, according to Carruthers means “new and valuable action schema”. So a random number or pattern would be new - but not valuable. A random scribble would also be new but not valuable. Writing up a literature review looking at multiple different articles requires a little unique thought in how you would combine them, and you have created something new and valuable too. But at the same time, this definition seems to lack a little rigour. Should it be specifically for humans? I mean the way nature looks is randomly determined by the laws of Physics, Chemistry and Biology but it is valuable the same way a work of art or TV show is valuable, it makes me happier. Does that mean that the laws of Physics are creative? They created something new and valuable? But at the same time they aren’t human.<br>
One other problem with this is really the definition of value, because different things would be valuable to different people. I think the way that nature looks is very much valuable to me, but this is not the case for everyone as “beauty” is subjective.<br>
What about things that come from computers that are new and also valuable, like OpenAI DALL-E and MuseNet? Can computers be creative? If that is the definition of creativity, “new and valuable”, then surely computers CAN be creative. Is that not odd? Creativity coming from perfectly mathematical and algorithmic computers? There is a solid distinction between creativity and algorithmic natures. An algorithm is just a set of instructions set by a programmer for the computer to complete in that specific way.<br>
In the case of GANs and AI algorithms, a lot of this is not totally algorithmic because it stems from randomness and applies an algorithm to that (essentially the working principle of the GAN).<br>
But I have only really talked about one form of creativity with my examples of nature and AI art and that is creating things that are aesthetically pleasing. Aesthetics is a whole different confusing issue but there is another form of creativity. I’m talking about creative problem solving, where you maybe make random interconnections between abstract entities in order to solve a problem (not the most general description), i.e. “you think outside the box”. I wonder what the “box” actually means though? Is it the restriction that the way you do things normally has places on your freedom of thought? Maybe it is? Maybe doing maths or engineering in a particular way with a particular heuristic stops you from seeing other creative and efficient ways of solving a problem? This type of creativity seems to underpin technological innovation. All of these algorithms seem to have come about due to creatively thinking about the problem at hand and coming up, seemingly randomly, with a solution that just works so well. I still don’t understand how people come up with the things they do in Physics, Computer Science and Maths research. An idea randomly pops into their head and it seems so far away from everything they’ve done so far yet it just works so well? Maybe it starts as the seedling of an idea, like a thought about something maybe unrelated and due to experience they can develop that idea further into something that is actually useful? With the “new and valuable action schema” definition this example of creative problem solving seems a lot more objectively applicable. Stories and such that someone has creatively come up with are likely to be valuable to many but not all. My “creative writing” stories are only valuable to me. I still do wonder about both of these categories of creativity I guess because I too would like to come up with creative solutions to computing problems and at the same time come up with interesting and philosophical stories. If there was some sort of “creativity hack” and ideas didn’t just come randomly then I’m sure society would look very different. I would therefore say that in my opinion creativity is the most valuable thing that we have as humans. I have also concluded that I do not know enough about this topic and will probably revisit this again having read more about it, but I have thought about it in depth now I guess.</p>
