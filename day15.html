  <h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="Talking_about_it_0"></a>Talking about it</h5>
  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">This article is partly inspired by my own experience, and by this video by introvertedmadness called “can music actually save your life?”. I don’t know if that title’s verbatim, and I can’t be bothered to link it - but if you really want to, I’m sure you can find that video, YouTube search isn’t Bing.</p>
  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Mental health is something of a buzzword isn’t it. Everyone seems to care so much about it, and that’s a good thing because it’s important. It’s just that it does seem to me, and many other people perhaps, that no one ever properly talks about it. It’s somewhat of a taboo to actually go in depth with how you’re feeling isn’t it? It’s embarrassing from your point of view, and maybe you’re like me and you feel “well holy shit how can I complain, I’m in a first world country, middle class and extremely lucky otherwise - me complaining about my mental health would just be contrived”. Lots of people have different mental illnesses, many of which I’m lucky to not have experienced - but I suppose because I can empathise most with it, I’m going to talk about something I experienced - but because this article is not about me, I’m not going to talk about it from my point of view. It would again be contrived to talk about eating disorders or something when I’ve never experienced them myself. I also think I can get my point across with an example and a case study.</p>
  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Not understanding OCD is a kind of stereotype in itself, like it’s a stereotype to mistake people being overly neat and wanting their pencils in order or wanting a frame to be straight as OCD. At the very least, much of that has been cleared up. OCD is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and I think now people realise it can apply to a lot of stuff, and public knowledge of standard OCD is better. I’m not an expert on OCD despite having read a lot about it, so I’m not going to go in depth. I felt like I had a good understanding of OCD, having gone through what I’d call standard OCD that affected my life to a moderate extent. There is however a lesser known type of OCD, which I believe is bad specifically because it’s lesser known. This type of OCD is called Pure-OCD, which suggests that it’s purely an obsessive disorder, i.e. when you can’t stop thinking about something, but that’s a debatable name because there ARE compulsions, they’re just more subtle. I suppose a better name for it is “intrusive thought OCD”. Everyone has intrusive thoughts sometimes, but depending on your situation or the way you think, some intrusive thoughts can disturb you so deeply that you simply cannot stop thinking about them, and it gets worse and worse and worse. A lot of the time you can’t tell it’s OCD as well, you can’t tell that these intrusive thoughts are lies - and you think whatever they say is true. This is what I had, but I’m not going to go into specifics because this is not about me, but I could always talk about one of the case studies I read and that broke my heart kinda. Imagine you’re a parent and you have young kids, maybe about the age of 5. Now imagine you start having intrusive thoughts that you’re a paedophile, and you imagine harming your children. You’re not a paedophile and you don’t want to harm your children - but you don’t know that do you? In fact, the fear and sickness caused by this intrusive thought might cause fear arousal - and you could mistake that fear arousal for a different kind of arousal, reinforcing your belief (this is an actual effect, I’ve read about this). You’re absolutely convinced you are a paedophile, you’re convinced that your presence near your children means something bad will definitely happen. The thought of hurting your own children disturbs you and makes you sick of yourself to the very core. Maybe you have views on suicide like, you should always live out your life no matter what! And life shouldn’t be wasted! But what if living was immoral? What if you didn’t kill yourself, and one day your “secret urges” got the better of you, and you harmed those you loved most? Perhaps suicide is the only moral way out? Maybe you should get help from a therapist, but can you really tell anyone about this? Can you really tell people that you might be a paedophile? You already see where this is going, and this is not a mental illness that I could’ve imagined - but that specific scenario - a parent thinking they’re a nonce is so so common. But guess what, it’s so difficult for them to get help for it. They don’t know it’s an intrusive thought - since this isn’t a mental illness that people talk about - so they might never even consider getting help - because getting help to them would be a confession.</p>
  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Even if they did try getting help, due to how little the mental illness is understood by the general public, some governments might just remove their kids. This was one common yet specific scenario of pure-OCD. Pretty much all of the others are similar, and it seems to have a pretty high suicide rate too - which from my point of view honestly makes sense. No matter your view on suicide, if you feel like your existence could have a massive net-negative impact and you think you may one day cause serious harm to someone , I feel like suicide would start looking like a real option. This whole thing is fed by the extreme lack of awareness that Pure-OCD is even a thing. It is well documented now. My therapist seemed to know a lot about it. But because the nature of intrusive thoughts is disturbing by definition (it wouldn’t linger unless you truly found it disturbing), talking about it is a real taboo. And because no one talks about it, no one knows it’s a thing. Simply knowing that your intrusive thoughts are just that, intrusive thoughts, makes things so much easier, and you can actually get help from qualified professionals who do know a lot about this, but some people never find that out. Imagine the agony that could be saved if people just knew about it.</p>
  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">That was an example of one very particular mental illness. I would very much like more people to know that Pure-OCD is a thing, because not knowing it’s a thing is literally a partial cause of it. Also, in presenting it, I did omit specifics of my own experience. I think that’s something people could do. I find it totally understandable that someone wouldn’t want to complain about their mental health, so they can always just talk about a case study that they feel they can empathise with. I feel like for mental illness in general, knowing that you aren’t the only one in the world feeling this way and knowing that you’re not alone is the first part of recovering.</p>
  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">In conclusion, you get my point. Discuss mental health more, and if you don’t wanna talk about your own (and I don’t) - talk about case studies you feel you can understand well. Also this might sound stupid but although I wish I'd never been through that, I think it has good character creation potential (see fiction and experience).</p>
