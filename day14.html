<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="Fiction_and_experience_0"></a>Fiction and experience</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">My thoughts here aren’t entirely fully formed, but I’d like to give it a go anyway. I’m also not at all qualified.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">When you’re reading a novel written in first person, and the character goes through some stuff in the novel - stuff that you have probably never experienced before as a reader, I know that the writer would like the reader to experience to some extent the emotions that the character went through. But surely, to portray a truly authentic image of the emotional state of a character in a novel, you need to have some intuition as to what they would feel.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">There are many people in this world in extremely shit situations, and although I sympathise greatly with these people, I definitely do not “understand what they are going through” because I’ve never gone through anything similar or watched anyone close to me go through anything similar. A major theme in “It Ends with Us” is abuse, especially by a person you love. This is not something I have ever come close to experiencing, and noone close to me has experienced abuse either. I cannot imagine at all what that would feel like. The book being in first person allows you to see what the character feels to an extent and their emotions and most of all their confusion, but for an author to capture an authentic and accurate portrait of this - I really feel like they need to truly empathise with the character.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9">The reason I’m slightly unsure of what I’m saying here is that I don’t entirely know how authors manage to make me as a reader feel a particular way. They describe the thoughts going through the character’s head I suppose. They have their ways of representing anger through the behaviour of characters mixed in with their internal monologue. I’m not an experienced fiction writer, so I don’t know if I’m qualified to say this - but I feel like to weave an authentic internal monologue - you do need to empathise with the characters greatly.<br>
This isn’t all though. Another facet of experience in situations is knowing how humans would actually react in a particular situation. People aren’t rational in emotionally tense situations, but since I’ve never been through what they’ve been through, I can’t possibly know what they’ll do.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">In exurb1a’s podcast about creating things, the same one where he talked about creative nihilism which I’ve talked about before, he mentioned turning your pain into something positive through creativity. I think that people who have been through shit that no one deserves to be through (as well as adequate practice in writing) would be brilliant and authentic writers since they have a grasp of emotions in certain situations which the general public doesn’t, and knowledge of how to truly get emotions across and craft characters to match. I’ve been through negative stuff that most people probably haven’t (but everyone goes through negative stuff that other people probably haven’t - so I’m not pretending my life is particularly bad or anything), and I feel like I am qualified to talk about the feelings I went through in this situation, but I don’t think I know enough about creative writing to get my emotions across adequately. I did attempt to though (<a href="http://whadk.repl.co/day9">whadk.repl.co/day9</a> *), and I’m proud of that. Some people have had a lot more experiences, so maybe they would make better writers naturally.</p>
