<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="How_I_want_to_debate_0"></a>What shapes my opinions on stuff?</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="6">I try to be a critical thinker, I try really hard to. That’s literally what all this is about, however I have begun to wonder why I hold particular opinions. Also like, opinions in general are quite confusing right?<br>
Anyways I can’t know if I’m biased or not. I’m probably in my own echo chamber, surrounded with friends who think the same things that I do. I consume content recommended to me by an algorithm. Maybe I am biased but I don’t want to be. How do I know that everything I think isn’t determined by the algorithm?<br>
Ok, my thoughts aren’t being particularly structured here, I have just rambled a whole lot.<br>
Let me think about this in a structured and rational way.</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="10">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9">What is an opinion anyway?<br>
So basically I have a particular take on a particular thing, for example I might think that left wing politics are better or abortion is a good thing or drugs should be legalised or private education shouldn’t exist. But opinions can’t be right or wrong, so that just means people hold these meaningless beliefs? Can they be right or wrong? Ok in the case of something like “drugs should be legalised” maybe one is better for society than the other? Politics is too confusing as it is, which one is better for society anyway? And them some are just to do with morality as a whole. Ok speaking from philosophy there are many different schools of morality, like deontological ethics utilitarianism etc. But who decides which one of these is right? Everything is meaningless and we don’t know what is objectively right or wrong, someone just says stuff like “let’s be utilitarian” or “lying is wrong no matter what” and some people like it and follow it and other people follow a different one. And them some people just accept the meaninglessness in a slightly odd way and go “nothing matters anyway so why should I care about morality” which I don’t think is right, but oddly enough I can’t articulate why that’s wrong. I don’t know which form of morality I believe in, to be honest I don’t really know anything. It’s just at the same time as being extremely convoluted and dependent on what you believe to be moral or if you even are moral at all, opinions are quite important. I mean opinions shape the way you interact with the world don’t they? When it comes to stuff like voting you get the chance to put your preference forward and then whoever has the most people voting for them gets the bag.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="13">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="12">What shapes your opinions?<br>
Probably the people who surround you (echo chambers) and the content you consume (also basically echo chambers). I don’t get politics at all to be honest, we vote for a particular right wing or left wing or middle wing party and whoever gets the most votes wins but it’s all really complicated and what party you vote for just depends on all sorts of different stuff and it seems like the most rational people seem to just vote for the party that benefits them the most but when you start thinking about what benefits society as a whole the most you get into extremely subjective debates which blur the lines between right and wrong. It gets weird with social media and algorithms though because they all just want you to look at your screen for longer so they can give you more ads and make you money but in doing that they have to give you stuff you like and ever so slightly make your current beliefs a bit more extreme to one end until you feel like no matter what your opinion is right. I don’t know if I hold beliefs like that, maybe this is one of them? Maybe this whole paranoia that my opinions are manipulated and shaped by an algorithm is shaped by an algorithm? But how am I supposed to avoid this? Even if I avoid an algorithm altogether, and try to get information from the newspaper and books I see, then my worldview is going to be influenced by the opinions of the person who wrote that book? To me right now it seems like the only thing I can do to not be manipulated is simply be neutral and stay on the fence about every issue and try to think critically about everything, but my critical thinking isn’t perfect. Emotions are a thing that exist. Emotions can cloud judgement and critical thinking, therefore no matter what I feel like I will end up holding a subjective opinion about something.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="16">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="15">Debating (on the internet especially)<br>
Internet debates are so sad to watch. I can’t say I’m a perfect critical thinker but it always seems like both sides are rife with fallacies and they aren’t pointing each sides fallacies out at all so you just end up with an absolute mess. Debating in real life is better. Sometimes real life debates can give rise to new, better ideas perhaps but even then, the conclusions of a debate really just depend on the critical thinking abilities of the people involved and whether they have a particular point to make at that particular time, so maybe something like correspondence debates are better where people argue over a period of time. Even then though, for many cases having a big number of arguments for something and a big number of arguments against still seems to never be enough to decide anything. Perhaps in some cases were the arguments against are particularly bad and one side clearly outweighs the other, that works - but that’s not always the case is it? In other cases the arguments for and against basically weigh the same and what people pick just depends on their own cognitive biases.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="18">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="18">Conclusion<br>
I have no idea if what I said represents the truth of the matter in any way, and I really doubt it does because this whole opinion thing is so weird. At the same time however, I am trying my best to be open minded. I’m not emotionally attached to any of my opinions. I don’t make my opinions my beliefs and I’m trying not to let “being wrong” about something hurt my ego too much. This is what I think right now. I’m going to read more about this whole thing (although I have already read a lot, but how do I know that what I’ve read isn’t biased) and perhaps think more about it too. It is so confusing though, maybe the only answer is to not overthink it and go with the flow? This is why I would stick to Maths and Physics where everything is objective and there aren’t blurry lines between sides like in Economics, Politics and Sociology.</p>
