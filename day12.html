<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="Creative_Nihilism_0"></a>Creative Nihilism and subjectivity</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="5">Most people probably don’t like much of the music that I really like. Similarly I don’t really like a lot of the music they like. If I was to make my own music, why should it matter what my friends think of it? All that would matter is that I like it. Even if they did like it, if I didn’t like it, what’s the point? I mean it’s different when you think about art and creativity as a career, because to make the money you need to appeal to the masses. I feel like that’s kind of limiting though. The idea that you need to appeal to a lot of people to be successful as an artist. Maybe some music that doesn’t appeal to as many people would appeal to a small group of people a lot? Kind of like a cult-following status you get on some films, but what if that group of people is really really small? That way the artist would not earn much from it, but the people who like it would enjoy it a lot indeed. If as an artist your priority at the moment is not to earn money e.g. you have a career anyway, then this is the ideal situation to be in. Doing something on the side and making stuff that you absolutely love. Otherwise, I can see how this would get frustrating. If you focused all of your effort on the art and that was your only career, then to sustain yourself you’d need to have a following of more people. Also if you did have a separate career, that would mean the quality of the art would not be as much as someone who focuses only on the art. But you’d need to be extremely brave and resilient to spend all of your time and effort creating art that only very few people would appreciate, and it would probably not end up working out. Although, another possibility would be to make art that more people would find popular, if you have the talent to do so - even if you don’t like that art and rise to popularity and have enough money that way. Then you can spend the rest of your time working on art you truly do like. That kinda still seems like the “find another career on the side” type thing I already discussed though.<br>
Going back to the point at hand though, I used to think that less popular artists would look at really famous artists and feel jealous and like they’re lesser artists. But this shouldn’t really be true (it might be, I’m not an artist and I don’t think I will end up being one). Technically, if you like your art and you have at least some people who truly really like your art, and it makes their life just a bit less dull - you should feel happy with it. Just because artists are more popular doesn’t necessarily make them better, because aesthetics is purely subjective and something that appeals to more people doesn’t make it aesthetically better. If the art appeals to no one though (much like my music), then this doesn’t really apply. I don’t like listening to my own music, in fact I absolutely hate it for the most part but I think there are some things I’ve done that are creative and interesting. Even though it’s mostly bad, there are some elements which I’d like to carry forward. I eventually aim to make music/science fiction stories that I would personally enjoy reading, regardless of what others think.<br>
At the same time though, feedback is important. In the spirit of creative nihilism and making whatever you think is good, you might gloss over finer details that you have stored in your brain but you can’t quite get across to people who are viewing your art. Like if you’re writing a story and you really enjoy your own story, you fill in all the missing plot points and details when you’re reading it to yourself again, but someone else reading that wouldn’t understand it at the same level. Feedback like that could be important. I can’t quite think how that would exactly apply to music though, maybe someone has a suggestion or feedback that would make your music better sounding to you.</p>
