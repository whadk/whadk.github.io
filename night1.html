<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="Therapist_0"></a>Therapist</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">This is what I call a “psy-fi” story. Obviously it’s not perfect, I think that I made the interviews far too short, but I personally like the concept and the story itself, though a little nonsensc ical approaching the end, is alright too. I could do a lot better, but this is an okayish start. </p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">6 murders and they have three common factors.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">All of the perpetrators were patients of a single therapist, Dr Lorenz.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">All of them felt nothing but grief, and they all believe they were either drunk or blacked out and murdered in rage as they don’t remember what happened the day before.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="10">They all murdered someone they seemingly loved.<br>
Now it’s my job to find out why. I’ve solved many a murder in the past, but this has to be one of the most curious cases. I’m absolutely sure that the therapist has something to do with it. All of the patients he has held in the past year have committed such murders. I simply need to find out what this man has been doing, and prove it. We can’t retract his medical license without reason, and there’s nothing to stop him taking on more clients.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=10 data-line-end=11 ><a id="Interview_1__11032023_10"></a>Interview 1 - 11/03/2023</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">This was my first time interviewing Dr Lorenz. This took place at his house. “It’s Detective Esposito on behalf of the police. I have a few questions”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">He slowly opens the door to his, frankly rather tatty house. His front yard is small and has overgrown weeds and an uneven surface of grass. The facade seriously needs a repaint and is painted with a rough off-white tint. His door is green with dozens of splinters coming off it, and two massive scratches as if it’s been attacked by a grizzly bear. He lives alone.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="18">He lets me in without saying anything. He is a trustworthy looking man. Clean shaven, an age of around 50 with black-gray hair that expands radially out of his spherical head and curls at the top in a rather aesthetically pleasing wave. “Follow me” he says and walks literally two steps to a room with two chairs. One new-looking couch and a tatty, uncomfortable chair. His voice is brilliant. It’s the kind of voice that reads audiobooks, and it’s sad that the majority of a therapist’s job is to listen. This must be his therapy room, and quite possibly his living room too considering how small the rest of the house is.<br>
There is no television and no books. The room is plain. The walls are painted grey and the ceiling white. A singular bulb hangs off a thin cable, it almost looks like the cable can’t handle the weight of the bulb. It’s tortured, and has little brown marks across it, as if it were burned. Dr Lorenz wears a brown blazer on a plain white T-shirt, and has blue trousers. An odd colour combination, and I can’t tell whether they’re old or new.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="23">He sits down on the tatty old chair, and beckons me to the couch.<br>
“What can I help you with?”<br>
“All of the clients you’ve held in the past year have ended up committing murder. They’ve all killed their loved ones, and then said that they’re not sure why they did it and were likely in a drunken haze. Care to explain why?”<br>
He sighs and then sucks in a little bit of air. I feel his eyes on me, scanning every pixel, no doubt trying to make inferences about my character. Maybe he sees the little cat hairs on my jacket and “infers” that I have a cat, even though I don’t? Maybe he notices the eyebags and the way I keep moving my fingers in a particular way to stop the dull pain of carpal tunnel syndrome? Maybe he puts two and two together to see that I’ve stayed up late many nights in a row, typing and typing, and I hate myself for it and my current situation and wouldn’t do anything to escape this menial labour. Maybe he realises how excited I am to be here, actually talking to someone, even if that someone is potentially an indirect murderer. Maybe he can tell how lonely I am, how I don’t have many people left in my life.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">“All of my clients are very troubled, and I have sworn a contract of secrecy. I can’t tell you anything even if I wanted to,” he says, averting his gaze, “not that I would want to anyway”. His face is expressionless, and his pupils are size nominal. He clearly doesn’t want to give anything away. I should try that blank-slate strategy next time, even though it might be too late for me now that he’s seen me as I am. If I do try to act expressionless and sociopathic next time, I think he’d be smart enough to pick up on that and realise that I’m imitating him. I won’t do that.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="28">I try a different tack. “Your fees are extremely expensive, and yet you still live in a small, tatty old home in a pretty bad neighborhood. Why?”<br>
“I like to go on holiday a lot. I have enough money to live, and I don’t take on many clients anyway-”, “yeah because they all end up in prison for murder a couple months after taking you on as a therapist” I interject, he doesn’t reply. We sat in silence for 30 seconds that seemed like millennia.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">“Why do you charge so much?” I ask finally, “I’m different, I suppose. My patients genuinely want to come to me. I do research, you know. I was quite reputed back in the day as a psychotherapy researcher, and my techniques are rather innovative”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="33">Rather innovative. Hmm. All 6 of his patients are murderers, and he’s still a practicing psychotherapist. Innovative? In all of the cases, the patients murdered someone they loved.<br>
Alyssa, aged 24, stabbed her best friend Jasmine. Murdoch, aged 19, shot his mother - his friends and family commented that their relationship was extremely wholesome, supporting each other and whatnot. Evelyn, aged 37 drowned her husband of 8 years in the bathtub after having 2 kids. What’s the point of therapy anyway? Surely murdering the people you love shows that the therapy didn’t work on you? What are these innovative techniques? I don’t have anything more to ask so I decide to end the interview here, and I take my leave.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=34 data-line-end=35 ><a id="11032023_evening_34"></a>11/03/2023, evening</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">I wanted to see exactly what these “innovative techniques” were, so I decided to look him up on Google Scholar. “good schizophrenia, using schizophrenia to cure pure-OCD and depression”, “schizophrenia and creativity”, “preventing negative thoughts using schizophrenia”, “inducing temporary schizophrenia using the LSD-stk drug”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">Hmm.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">Interesting.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">So his strategy was to make his patients temporarily schizophrenic for the sake of psychotherapy? I wonder what hallucinations he forced onto them. Did they backfire, or is that his murder method? But how? Like those tacky cliche horror stories where the murderer doesn’t know who’s real and their hallucination tells them to be rid of someone else to cure their schizophrenia and they end up killing them? Surely not. It would be funny if that were true though.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=43 data-line-end=44 ><a id="18032023_Interview_2_43"></a>18/03/2023, Interview 2</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="48">I set my recorder next to me on the couch,<br>
“Induced schizophrenia, do you ever worry that it’ll backfire and cause a patient to accidentally commit murder?”. “There are no accidents,” he says “it only ever fires in the direction I want it to”. He winks suspiciously. It almost feels like a confession, but I can’t prove anything yet. I feel at a loss. I have a solid feeling that he is a murderer. I know some semblance of his means and opportunity but I can’t prove either of those, and what on earth is his motive? Is he a psychopath who kills for pleasure, or are his indirect murders targeted? I do feel like he takes pleasure in me knowing his little secret but feeling unable to do anything about it. It makes me feel so angry, I can feel my blood boil. I finally lose it. “Why do you do it? Why do you get your clients to kill people?”<br>
“As I’ve said already, my clients are highly troubled people. There is something wrong with them, that’s why they kill their loved ones.” He said this with a defiant smile. It’s as if he forced that expression on so that it’d make me more angry. But I keep my anger to myself. I have good control of my anger usually, which is valuable in my profession.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="51">“You say you have innovative techniques, but they don’t help anyone do they, turning them into murderers?”<br>
“I’m afraid I have to disagree. My sessions give my nihilistic and depressed clients meaning, and subdue their intrusive thoughts. Why do you think they keep coming back?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53">“I know you killed them indirectly. I will prove it one day,” I say, trying to keep my internal anger at bay. He remains expressionless. And I once again take my leave.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=54 data-line-end=55 ><a id="25032023_Interview_3_54"></a>25/03/2023, Interview 3</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="57">This time he speaks first. “Your interviews are always so short,” he says, again expressionlessly. He’s wearing the same clothes he wore the last two times, but they are clean. This man has ruined countless lives, and here I am making chitchat. I’ve begun to get bored of these interviews. I decided to simply ask him questions about himself. Who was this man? He found a way to redirect it back to me. I turned off my voice recorder, and decided to leave once again. I had no evidence, after 3 interviews. Every question I asked got redirected. This man was playing me like a fiddle.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=58 data-line-end=59 ><a id="26032023_Interview_4_58"></a>26/03/2023, Interview 4</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">This time I didn’t bring my voice recorder. In place of my voice recorder in my left pocket is a small pistol. I know what I have to do. “Evelyn was one of your clients right?” I asked. He stared, expressionless. He didn’t nod or shake his head. “She murdered her husband. Benito Esposito, that was my brother”. He didn’t change his expression, he showed no remorse. “She came to me, she said she had no idea why she did it and the moment before he died stuck with her playing out over and over in her brain. She doesn’t care that she’s in prison”. He still didn’t do anything. He’s like a statue. I can see him breathing, his chest heaving in and out. That’s the only proof I have he’s not a wax statue. “You’ve taken almost everyone in my life away from me”. I pull out my pistol and direct right in between his eyes. He starts laughing. “I know, it only fires the way I want it - as I’ve said already” he said. I pulled the trigger, and time seemed to slow down. As the bullet followed its trajectory, the environment around me faded in from a tatty-ass therapy room with grey walls to a coffee shop. “For your information, you’re no detective,” he says, “you’re a patient - why else do you think you visit me for an interview once every week? You used to be a writer but posting stories on r/nosleep and getting lots of upvotes doesn’t pay the bills and now you live in a run-down flat and are thousands of pounds in debt. And the person you just shot at is not Dr Lorenz, it’s your friend John, who also happened to be the one to pay for your expensive therapy”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">Sure enough, the face of Dr Lorenz contorted to the frightened face of my friend John. The realisation hit me like a bullet, as the actual bullet penetrated the skull of my best friend. The only person left in my life. All the blood drained out of my brain as if I’d been subject to a G force of 342 and I fainted.</p>
