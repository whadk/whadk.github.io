<h5 id="current-thoughts-on-psychedelics">Current thoughts on psychedelics</h5>
<p>I’ve been curious about psychedelics for many years now, but I’ve only really started doing in-depth research into psychedelics and their effects now. I’ve specifically looked into LSD, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in particular. This is me consolidating stuff I’ve learned from documentaries, youtube videos on neuroscience and multiple podcasts, as well as thinking about this stuff myself and relating it to my own conscious experiences. I would like to be rational and open-minded about this topic, but safety is of utmost importance. 
The first thing to note that I have learned for sure now is that LSD is very different to other drugs in terms of its effects on the brain and body. I was under the impression that all illegal drugs have extreme effects physiologically, however, LSD is different since it has little to no effect physiologically. Simply, an increase in blood pressure - which makes LSD unsuitable physiologically for people with heart disease. Of course I’m going to continue to be sceptical about its safety just in case. We haven’t completed research on LSD. There is no evidence that LSD is unsafe in any way physiologically, but it could be doing something much deeper that we haven’t encountered so far. At the very least however, if LSD is unsafe it hasn’t been apparent at all in multiple clinical tests across a large number of people, and through an in-depth analysis of the neuroscience and neuropharmacology of LSD and its action on the brain. I do trust our understanding of science enough to know that this is probably accurate, but obviously our understanding is not perfect. 
Furthermore, LSD has also been shown to be non-addictive. That is another thing that surprised me because I was also under the impression that all illegal recreational drugs are extremely addictive which makes them all the more dangerous. 
LSD is not safe, however. It is safe physiologically, and not at all addictive - but it can pose a threat to you and the people around you if you hallucinate a bunch and have no sense of orientation. Like if you hallucinate so much you jump out the window thinking it’s something else entirely. It can cause lots of erratic and otherwise dangerous behaviour in people, and that’s why LSD is a dangerous drug. It can definitely be safe in certain situations however, such as in a controlled environment surrounded by psychiatrists and medical professionals. Especially where the person who is trying the LSD is lying down.</p>
<p>Low doses and creativity
The thing that interests me most about LSD is its potential use for creative problem-solving. There is a particular study where they collected architects, engineers, physicists and other knowledge workers who have problem-solving as part of their job, and asked them to work on a problem they were stuck on in their field while under the effect of a low dose of LSD. I don’t know the entire effect, but most problems were solved completely. Some found a new way to model the problem. In effect, the conclusion of that study was that low doses of LSD definitely boost creative problem-solving skills in one way or another (to be honest I haven’t looked far enough into the study to understand how they made it fair, and how they eradicated biases - I’m sort of just trusting it here). I find that hugely interesting because the whole concept of creative problem-solving potentially affects the entire human race. Imagine if there was a creativity hack where people could just take a drug and suddenly come up with an innovative solution? Creativity and innovation are the most valuable skills we have as humans in my opinion, and a way to improve these skills for everyone to innovate better is exciting for me. That said, I don’t think we can go off the basis of one single study, but there have been many more examples of cases where psychedelics have acted as an agent for creative problem solving. 
An interesting example to me was Kary Mullis, the inventor of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and subsequently the winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He credited his invention to psychedelics, not because he was on psychedelics when he invented it - but because his previous experiences with psychedelics had shaped the way he thought and approached problems in chemistry in a way that allowed him to get creative with it better. I think in terms of creative problem-solving therefore, the effect LSD has on different people varies so significantly, we can’t conclusively say that LSD definitely boosts creative problem-solving in everyone - but it has definitely helped many people solve problems creatively and I think been a positive influence in the world due to that. It’s not the wonder creative intelligence drug though. At the same time, I don’t think we do enough studies on creative problem-solving, there have been many people talking about LSD and creative problem-solving but few studies. There isn’t enough evidence here to convince me, but the concept is still exciting. I also have close to no understanding of why LSD would work in this way. 
Therapy
To be honest, my understanding of what it’s like to be on LSD and why it’s like that is close to none. I haven’t taken LSD before and if I do end up taking (which I won’t do without more research into the topic), it will be in a while. The most widespread use of LSD that is a very active research area now is in treating mental illnesses such as addiction, depression, OCD and others. People’s description of what they see during a high-dose LSD trip (which is common for therapy) ranges from truly nightmarish to beautiful. Psychiatrists that guide these LSD trips say to try to accept whatever it is. I don’t understand why people see what they see, but it does seem to have (from research) very powerful therapeutic potential, often totally curing things like addiction and depression. I don’t have any intuitive understanding of how this works. 
In particular, for the therapy of pure OCD, I feel like LSD could be helpful despite having no understanding of how LSD works in therapy.  Pure OCD is defined as having repetitive thought patterns and cycles that are toxic. Everyone gets intrusive thoughts, but sometimes if an intrusive thought disturbs you particularly and you are prone to OCD, you get caught up in a repetitive cycle. You think about that intrusive thought often, and you start wondering why you had it. You then keep thinking this way, and it starts to become an obsession. It gets worse if there is a real-life cue that triggers your pure OCD. Sometimes it might cause an unwanted physical sensation and you have to keep checking that this physical sensation is just an illusion, a trick of the mind rather than anything else. I believe that LSD would help to disrupt this toxic, repetitive cycle of intrusive thoughts. Even though you don’t know you have pure OCD until much later and rather you think you are what you are not, you know deep deep down that the thoughts are just thoughts and not true descriptions of your reality. But, the cycles of intrusive thought sort of bury that feeling and make you feel more and more guilty instead. And that just becomes a vicious cycle. From what I know of LSD so far, I think it would reframe the situation, maybe you’d de-personalise and see yourself as an outsider or something like that. This is pure theory (although some people have described their experience to be like that). I’m not sure how it would work, but I feel that for OCD it would simply disrupt those patterns of thought. 
Conclusion
I think it’s really really important to be open-minded about this topic. Too many people reject any mention of psychedelics because they see them the same way as every other illegal recreational drug. They believe they’re physiologically harmful and addictive - which they are not. I will not deny that LSD is dangerous and I wouldn’t personally take it straight away without a safe environment provided (I don’t think there are any in the UK if I can get a safe environment, I will try it - I’m not going to try it unsafely like on the street or something), but from the research that’s been done so far, I do think that they have the potential to be extremely beneficial to society in many ways (in the right conditions of course). Despite this, I’m still not sure if they should be widespread, but maybe they will be. We also know remarkably little about LSD. We know that it acts on the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist, but it also acts on other serotonin receptors as well as adrenergic and dopamine receptors. I don’t think we understand how all of these work together to form psychedelic experiences. I find psychedelics fascinating for a lot of reasons, including what they seem to say about consciousness and the subconscious (which I haven’t discussed here), and I will probably continue to do research into them. The point of this essay was mostly a consolidation of what I know so far about them. </p>
