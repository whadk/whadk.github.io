<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="How_I_want_to_debate_0"></a>Should I care what people think of me?</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Should I put this thing on the internet where people who know me can see it and people who don’t know me can also see it but they don’t know who I am because I’m using a pseudonym which is only very loosely related to my incredibly common name? I am still going to put this up. I have sort of conquered my fear of constantly guarding the identity that I wish to project on to other people and realised that it doesn’t really matter in the end. But at the same time you shouldn’t totally disregard what other people think of you right? Because what people think of you changes the way they talk to you and react to you and that could be important psychologically. I saw this thing about the pygmalion effect which might not be correct in any way but it seemed interesting anyway because it was about how the way people react to you might affect the way you consider yourself and the way you behave towards them and it forms a sort of feedback loop.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Anyways that got me thinking about those people who genuinely don’t care whatsoever about what people think of them. I care to some extent but I have stopped letting that worry of what people think stop me from doing what I want. Another thing I considered is I used to be extremely worried that people would think I was stupid and wanted to come across as atleast a little smart every moment I could, but I’ve realised that that’s probably not that important. Maybe the pygmalion effect somehow affects this too, like if people think you’re stupid then they treat you as if you’re just below them and that affects your self image and you end up doing worse, but I don’t feel that way anymore atleast. It’s more because if someone thinks you’re stupid, they feel better about themselves so in some sense you’re doing other people a service by coming across as stupid. So if anyone thinks I’m stupid or below them in any way, go ahead I guess?</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Now, at the same time, should you care what you think of yourself? Because I did. I let my personal opinion of myself / my self esteem take decisions for me. Perhaps your self esteem is affected by the pygmalion effect thing I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Also about the point in the beginning, apart from the people who know me in person, noone knows who I am. So really why should I care at all about posting this on the interwebs?</p>
