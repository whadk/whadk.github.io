<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="How_I_want_to_debate_0"></a>Doing good better by Will MacAskill - book consolidation thing</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Possibly the first nonfiction book I’ve ever read where I haven’t read 3 pages and then had to reread the last 3 pages because I realised I wasn’t paying attention, and then had to repeat this process until I got totally bored of the book. Also possibly the first nonfiction book I’ve read where I can remember the stuff it said in enough detail for it to influence my thought process.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Anyways the book discusses how we as privileged individuals have the potential to have an astonishing impact on the world. One thing it did personally was help me see the value in economics and PPE because many of the conclusions it made were through economics. It also made me realise how incredibly lucky I am to live in a first world country. There were also some quite interesting but quite sad stories about how good intentions don’t necessarily lead to good outcomes. For example the PlayPump fiasco where someone thought they had the genius idea of making playground equipment which also doubles as a pump in deprived areas in Africa, except noone asked for it and it ended up being much more of a burden than anything else since it was too difficult to push for kids to play on and a lot more difficult to use than just a standard water pump. That isn’t something anyone could have predicted, but it could have been prevented if they had slowed down a little and experimented first. It also discussed fairtrade and anti-sweatshops which both had very much noble intentions but both failed too. Fairtrade is not a good system because it is firstly not very cost effective with  only a very very small fraction of the extra money you pay going to the farmers themselves, but even then doesn’t help and even detriments farmers that really need it in much poorer countries that can’t affort to get Fairtrade status. This was in a chapter called “the moral case for sweatshops” which also discussed how unfortunately sweatshop goods are a good thing since working in a sweatshop is sadly the ideal career for people in those countries, therefore actively trying to ban sweatshops at this time would have a worse impact - we should instead focus on trying to  make things better for them overall and making it so that working in a sweatshop doesn’t have to be the “best case scenario”. I particularly enjoyed the system used to measure impact on lives, or the QALY, the quality adjusted life year which is one extra year of life in perfect health.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Possibly the most interesting chapter for me was the one on picking a career. Prior to this I wanted to do research in Computer Science and/or Physics, and I still do, however it raised some very good points and had some good case studies on people.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">The main possibility that I hadn’t properly thought of before as simple as it is is earning to give. It says a lot about how just working harder in your job and donating the proceeds is better than volunteering. I still don’t want to do a high paying job in finance though because I wouldn’t enjoy it whatsoever, even if I’m donating a lot to charity. Also my values may wane, which is something the book discussed too giving a quote from someone who went into finance with the intention of donating a large proportion of his income to Giving What We Can but when you’re around people who may not be as “altruistically motivated” as you, that becomes a lot more difficult. I might end up becoming a worse and more materialistic person.  I still have some time before I need to decide a career and luckily I’ve picked a degree that allows a good amount of flexibility, but I still don’t really want to go into finance.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">The most impactful field of research that it does’t directly mention but I’ve found from my own research is research into AI safety as well as climate and agricultural. AI safety does indeed look very interesting too, so even if I do want to go into research I should be fine. It did also mention that combining two fields or interdisciplinary study is also a good choice since it’s likely a niche.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Anyways this book is very good, I wrote this just to consolidate but still.</p>
