<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="Atomic_habits_0"></a>Atomic habits</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="16">I am trying to build a habit of reading, so I suppose this book was a good book to start with. Actually, I think it’s better to say that: I am a reader. I didn’t often read books before but a change in my identity has occurred. I am now a reader. I have plenty of evidence for this too. I read “It Ends with Us”, listened to a lot of “thinking fast and slow” (impending book review for that coming too) and a significant portion of “Can’t hurt me”. Anyways, I’ve read lots of other books over the past year. I read “doing good better” and listened to half of “deep work” and some fiction too. (This portion was just me convincing myself that reading is a part of my identity so that I read more. I genuinely think it is now though.)<br>
I got atomic habits initially because I thought it would be useful, but it was also extremely interesting too. There were lots of ideas in it, supported with anecdotal evidence and real life studies that I found very interesting. One of the things in the book that I had thought about before is the impact of self-image and the identity I have of myself in my mind on my habits and motivations.<br>
For example, my experiences with A level chemistry have internalized that “I am bad at, and dislike Chemistry”. This scares me. Chemistry is linked to Physics. I will probably come across it again, and not only will I come across it, I may even like it. I find some parts of chemistry truly interesting, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m so bad at it that it has formed a part of my self-image. I need to get rid of this feeling though. I need to reaffirm a separate identity. Chemistry at A level was seriously odd, I don’t think the stuff I struggled with (i.e. memorising stuff). Stuff like quantum chemistry truly fascinates me. And though I hated Chemistry A-level and wanted it to go die in a hole sometimes, I don’t entirely regret taking it. I understand more about the world in some sense. Obviously doing Philosophy would have been nicer for me, and only doing 3 subjects would allow me to be more relaxed, but it wasn’t entirely a waste.<br>
Anyway that was a slight digression.<br>
Essentially, I have constantly found that my self-image impacts my motivations to do things for fun or because I like them. If I felt like I was bad at physics, I think I’d have a harder time being curious about it. Similarly if I’d kept telling myself before that I can’t read a book from start to finish then I’d be less motivated to even attempt to read a book. But as the evidence that I’m good at Physics and infact can voraciously read books and consolidate their content builds up, so does my motivation to read more.<br>
There were also various interesting strategies. Obviously, if someone other than me is reading this article, it’s probably just better to read the book itself - however I’m not writing this article for other people. I’d like to consolidate and internalise the contents of this book for my own sake and apply them to my own life.<br>
The two minute rule is just to frequently commit a habit for only 2 minutes and then you keep doing it just because you want to (atleast that was my interpretation of it).<br>
You can do habit stacking where you do one habit after another and temptation bundling where you bundle something you want to do with something that you need to do.<br>
Another thing I am excited to apply to my own life, and have thought about before too, is cues in your environment. For example if there’s something you do regularly in a particular space, just being in that space will prompt you to do it as a cue in itself.<br>
Also, the people that surround you influence your behavior too. I think I’m astoundingly lucky in this regard. Previously in year 12 and 13 I was lucky enough to be surrounded by people who were significantly smarter, more hard-working, sharper and more diligent than I was and next year I will be surrounded with even more such people at Oxford. I think by being around them, I have sort of inherited some of their qualities. I also felt a sense of belonging and like I had value to them, that’s not something that’s discussed in the book but I feel it is important. The book talks about social norms and how you get pulled into doing stuff the rest of society or your group does and also how we imitate the powerful - but one thing that I always found important while in a group context is to feel like my presence in the group is important. I want to feel like I am a unique asset - and wanting to be a unique asset acts as a motivation in its own right.<br>
Other people can also act as accountability partners. I think this is an interesting concept and I’ve heard of it before. I’ve always sort of wanted to start an Instagram page dedicated to my fitness and goals over time and have other people see them, and thinking about the opinions of other people would force me to be more productive. I mean I discussed in an earlier article that technically you shouldn’t care if other people think you’re bad because that makes them feel better about themselves, but I feel like even though that’s true and rational - I don’t think like that. I should use this irrationality to my advantage I guess.<br>
Finally, the book also discussed the role of talent. You have to pick a field that you are suited to. It gave the example of a swimmer called Michael Phelps and a runner whose name I don’t remember. They have wildly different body types and wouldn’t be nearly as successful if they switched careers. Also, you can combine fields. Everyone has fields where they can be in the top 25% with a little effort and if you combine multiple of these, you can be specialised in something and be different from the general populace. The book I read earlier, “doing good better”, discussed something similar with research fields. There seems to be a lot of value in gaining two unusual skills and combining them together in innovative and unexpected ways. In my case, Physics and Computer Science are the first that come to mind - although this combination is not niche at all. I do need to spend some time building new skills.<br>
There isn’t much else in the book itself that I’d like to talk about. Of course I need to keep it in mind if I want to apply it to my own life, but I don’t have much too much to discuss surrounding it.<br>
I could however write an entirely separate article on the appendix.</p>
