<h5 id="man-with-no-job-or-formal-qualifications-makes-a-groundbreaking-advancement-published-in-prestigious-journal">Man with no job or formal qualifications makes a “groundbreaking” advancement, published in prestigious journal</h5>
<h6 id="written-by-r-x-chigwellington">Written by R.🅱️.X. Chigwellington</h6>
<p>Mr. Higgleton Biggs, a 35 year old man who is currently unemployed and living in his grandmother&#39;s basement has made a research advancement some scientists consider absolutely “groundbreaking”. The 35 year old made an attempt at unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. He emailed his rather short paper to thousands of academics and journals all over the world, but many ignored it.</p>
<p>“I have a revolutionary and elegant theory”, he said, “I think I deserve a Nobel prize for this - on the level of Einstien or Feynmann, maybe even better”. He had in fact developed this theory  more than a decade ago, but few journals took him seriously. “Science is full of Nazis like that”, he said. “The scientific establishment in general is conspiring against me,” he explained. </p>
<p>But one influential particle physicist at Fermilab simply couldn&#39;t ignore it.</p>
<p> “It really was groundbreaking”, says Dr. Giovanni Ricatolli. “When I was procrastinating on my work and going through my spam email, I saw it, read it and instinctively smacked my 15 inch M2 MacBook Pro off the table, and it fell and hit my ceramic floor and made a big crack in the ceramic. Then I myself fell to the floor laughing and also made a big crack. I had broken my pelvis!”, he said grinning. Giovanni Ricatolli, with a H-index of 50 decided to take it upon himself to get Mr. Higgleton’s article published. With his large influence as a researcher, he managed to get it published in the relatively new journal called “Controversial Research Advancements in Cutting-edge Knowledge: Publications in Outlandish Theories”. This was after emailing multiple of his colleagues with the subject “GrOUNDBreAKinG ThEoRY AlErT: cmon let&#39;s get this published for shits and giggles”. “When I received this email from Giovanni, I thought to myself, damn - such elegant ideas, such innovative thought and it had gone ignored for so long? We needed to change that immediately.” said condensed matter physicist Dr. V.S. Davis - failing to stifle hysterical laughter. She immediately knew the person to ask, the founder of the “Controversial Research Advancements in Cutting-edge Knowledge: Publications in Outlandish Theories” journal himself. </p>
<p>But Higgleton&#39;s success didn&#39;t come easily. He had been emailing academics since he was 25, unable to get any response other than “KEKW” or “Is this a joke?”. Many had even called him a “crackpot”, a word he felt stifled scientific progress. But he persevered, “perseverance is the most important trait any theoretical physicist can have”, he explained to me. It wasn&#39;t just people on the internet, his parents too - one of whom was an engineer, told him to “drop it and get a f<em>*</em>ing job”. He also went to see a psychiatrist who attempted to convince him out of theories, but no, he had dogged determination and strong belief and simply kept trying and emailing. That is, until he found Giovanni Ricatolli. </p>
<p>When we asked his grandmother how she felt about her grandson’s amazing achievements, she replied “Well I knew he was spending a lot of time down there but I thought he was playing Fork-knife or Meinkraft and masturbating all day”, she said “I had no idea he was advancing Physics in this way. I&#39;m very proud”. </p>
<p>“My theory can actually be quite well understood by the general public”, he said. “It&#39;s not like most of Physics where you need to know loads of maths and random Greek symbols, I don&#39;t even know any maths and I still came up with it.” </p>
<p>This was his paper:</p>
<p>“The time has come: a unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>For years physicists have claimed that general relativity and quantum mechanics are not compatible, I have found a way to make them.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics says that two things can be in a superposition of two states, so general relativity can be in a superposition of working and not working at the same time. Therefore at any time we use general relativity it could be working or not working with quantum mechanics. So I suggest you just use it multiple times until it works. So simple and elegant. I&#39;m sure Einstien was clawing towards my ideas in his final years.”</p>
<p>He also attached a copy of his notes:
