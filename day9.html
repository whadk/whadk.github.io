<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="How_I_want_to_debate_0"></a>Trying to articulate OCD (secret page)</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">It’s very difficult to get the compounding of around 2 years of a constant cycling between panic, despair and nihilism down on a google doc but I will try, for therapeutic purposes at the very least, and better still to improve my writing skills. Anyway, while the current public awareness of OCD extends beyond “being neat”, I still don’t think many people are aware of the type of OCD I had to go through, and that unawareness that what I had was infact OCD perpetuated the seemingly infinite suffering. It starts with an intrusive thought. And then I start thinking about why I had that thought and go into a pattern of thinking about that thought every once in a while, until it starts seemingly fulfilling it’s own prophecy, I start having reactions which reinforce my damaging and completely untrue belief about myself - and this culminates in a panic as I can’t think about anything else and begin to feel extremely bad - descending into despair. I hate myself now. I want to kill myself now. It is the only way to escape it. I am a horrible and disgusting person, and my mere existence harms other people. The altruistic, utilitarian, caring for humanity route out is to kill myself isn’t it? Why am I not killing myself? I’m such a coward aren’t I? I’m too scared to do it even though it feels like the only route out to stop myself harming others? Noone else knows about my pain. I go to school and I mask it absolutely, I laugh, I do my work, I even somehow feel sad when I do badly in a test despite the fact that my brain is totally fucked up in another dimension, something that still confuses me. I still feel anxiety for the normal things people feel anxiety for, it’s like a side quest while my brain despairs and feels excruciatingly depressed about the person I think I am. I tell myself I’ll just hide this side from other people forever. If a conversation about the type of person I think I am comes up, I feel traumatised and feel the urge to run away. At this stage I’m simply trying my hardest not to think about it, and hoping that somehow the thoughts will vanish of their own accord. Trying to immerse myself in my studies and purposefully being anxious about only them, which honestly quite well. At this stage the nihilism kicks in and I start thinking “well, nothing matters anyway, even if I was this horrible disgusting person - I haven’t done anything bad to anyone yet and I won’t do it tomorrow or the day after, or next month or next year - so I’ll just try to enjoy life till then”. Looking back at this now, I still don’t understand how I managed to think like that, but I’m so grateful that I did. I then start thinking how perfect life would be if I wasn’t the type of person I thought I was. I eventually stop thinking about the thing for a while, especially if I’m overwhelmed with schoolwork. Until suddenly I get triggered again, and the cycle repeats. Sometimes I would get triggered multiple times in a single day. I can’t tell anyone about this thing. I must keep it to myself and let it eat me up inside. Noone can find out. I specifically try to avoid situations where I could be triggered. So I don’t tell anyone anything, I don’t even put it in my personal diaries or say anything about it until one day I have a full on mental breakdown. I can’t take this shit anymore. Life would be so great if I wasn’t this person. Why do I need to be me? Why? Critical thinking and rationality have kept telling me all this time “you aren’t this person you idiot”, and anyone looking at me from the outside would know if I told them. It’s just when you’re overcome with panic and despair, and absolutely convinced after more than a year of embedding it into your identity, critical thinking won’t cut it anymore. This was last august (2022). I was mentally exhausted from thinking about the same thing over and over and just dying on the inside, so I listened to the voice of reason and did some research and found out it was OCD. I found out that I wasn’t alone, and people who face this kind of thing sometimes have it way worse than I do. Just acknowledging and convincing myself that it was OCD did so much good for me. I read some of the symptoms of this type of OCD and realised how relatable it all was. I’m not special. My psychology doesn’t work in a different kind of way. I’m a normal human being, and some human beings are hit by this cursed mental illness and there’s a way out. It’s all just a nightmare. Since then I’ve basically just embedded the fact that this is OCD in my brain. Every time I got triggered since then I just remembered “damn that’s the devil speaking” and didn’t listen. Eventually the frequency went down a lot. I can’t say it’s completely gone yet. I told my therapist everything, and he was very much understanding about it and started talking about CBT and all that, but then I stopped going to therapy completely, so that explains why. I’m on the path to getting out of this mess though. Also I went to therapy for quite a while before this, and my aim for therapy was to eradicate the other issues I had at the time (interestingly enough, many of these were also OCD, but the more traditional kind and existed before all of this - maybe that habit of thinking about the same thing in a loop just carried forward?). I didn’t tell my therapist initially because I didn’t know it was OCD, I thought he’d see me as the person I thought I was and be alienated further. Hopefully writing this has been atleat a little bit therapeutic for me. Anyways fuck OCD, most cringe mental illness ever.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Also that sort of pulls away from the theme of this website and what I intended it to be used for a little bit, but I can do what I like and I want to put this on there.</p>
