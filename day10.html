<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="How_I_want_to_debate_0"></a>Articulating things</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Sometimes I stumble across a description of something which perfectly encapsulates my feeling about that one thing I felt that I simply couldn’t articulate properly. Maybe it’s because I hadn’t thought as clearly about that thing as I could’ve (i.e. not enough resources allocated to it), or I was trying to force myself not to think rationally about it due to the fear attached to the uncertainty of that thing (i.e. would the result of thinking about it in more detail make me feel even more shit?) or because I simply can’t articulate it because I don’t know how to. I feel like a big part of thinking about stuff is articulating it in an understandable, processable and communicable way (I don’t know if those are actually words but you get what I mean). But then, surely what language you use to articulate your thoughts affects how much you can think? I mean to be fair I already knew about that in a sense, the Sapir Whorf hypothesis. I’m not sure if that’s the same thing though. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is like, you think about things differently depending on the language. I’d say maybe your knowledge of language and ability to articulate affects the extent to which you can think. So learning more of a language affects your ability to think. Maybe that’s not true though. Thoughts aren’t in words. I’m not sure. It feels like when a thought springs into my head it isn’t fully formed yet and it’s more just a feeling or emotion, or an image. The only thing that concretely defines it is to articulate it or draw it. Maybe it is still a thought though, it’s just that you can’t communicate that thought to anyone else.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="6">To be fair, you don’t need to just articulate stuff with words. It could be diagrams/art or maths as well. If you don’t know enough maths you can’t articulate concepts in Physics that you could grasp the concept of at least. For example, in A level Physics, we get taught the principle of SHM without learning the detailed maths behind damping and whatnot but we get the concept, it’s just that we couldn’t model damping effectively. Maybe it’s similar to that? Also when product designers or engineers come up with a new visual solution, perhaps they have a picture of the thing in their head but to communicate it to others they need to model it with CAD or diagrams, and they’d struggle a lot if they have a beautiful visual model or solution in their head that they can’t communicate to others or model in a way that concretely defines it.<br>
This makes me feel like thoughts are abstract but when you try to articulate a thought you make it concrete. But sometimes when I try to articulate a thought it doesn’t seem to encapsulate the thought. Infact, and this is pretty meta, I don’t think what I’ve written here so far truly encapsulates my thoughts - but I can’t articulate it in a better way?</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9">Going back to the concept of Physics, to articulate something in words, maths or diagrams you need to think about it in a lot more detail and refine it. Perhaps that’s why Richard Feynman said that to understand something you need to explain it to someone else. I’ve tried that and it’s pretty cool because when you’re trying to articulate something which is really just a picture in your head, you see more clearly some logical disconnects which force you to question stuff you wouldn’t have questioned before. Does this translate to normal thought too? It probably does. It’s a lot more difficult to see rationally when you don’t articulate stuff and listen to yourself.<br>
So then, would cognitive biases be wiped out entirely if we tried to articulate in detail the justification for every decision we make? Probably not because we can’t critically think about everything we say (or atleast I can’t, as a human my critical thinking isn’t perfect). Perhaps if you tried to and bounced your justification off multiple other good critical thinkers, some will identify the flaw in your logic. But either way articulating what you think would atleast make it a bit easier to identify the flaws in your way of thinking. Maybe what I’ve just described here is psychotherapy? Because you talk to a therapist, and they’re listening so you need to choose your words and articulate which makes you realise parts where you’re not being so rational about the way you think, and your therapist will reply with the flaws in your logic. Actually therapists ask you a lot of questions too, and try to get you to articulate your thoughts about particular things, forcing you to think rationally about them to an extent too. Infact, as I’ve just realised, “black and white thinking” is a common cognitive bias, and also one that I’ve encountered in therapy.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">From writing this paragraph, I’ve decided I’d like to learn more about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and read “a very short introduction to psychotherapy”. I also need to read “thinking fast and slow” and maybe listen to some podcasts on this whole cognitive bias thing, it seems very interesting and quite relatable. At the same time however, I find this whole “how we think” and thought stuff sort of pseudoscientific and sometimes hogwash, though relatable. Maybe it’s really just an illusion? I don’t know. Behavioural science seems to use data to show how people behave and the evidence supports much of it.</p>
