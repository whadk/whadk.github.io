<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">James, at 14 years old, was a child prodigy. He excelled at every subject academically, although when it came to real life, failed at understanding other humans and their sometimes irrational motives for doing certain things. He understood numbers, philosophy and programming and could score extremely high in psychology tests despite not understanding why anything was the way it was. Why do people care so much about everything? Why do people feel the need to put other people down every moment they can? His confusion about human behaviour was not healed by trying to rationalise it, but he observed it regularly and memorised the rules of human interaction.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">One day his parents got a letter from the government.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">“Dear James Zoohansen,</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Your aptitude has been noticed by many. For the investigation of minds like yours, we would like to invite you to take part in a specialised test.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">For this reason, please arrive at the coordinate [-223, 44, 563.3] on the 14th of March 2056</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Yours sincerely, the DI8”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">James was quite excited and curious at this prospect, for he didn’t understand why he was so different and isolated from everyone else. He was unsure of what to expect but wanted to analyse every question he was asked or image he was shown. He wanted to know exactly why the test existed. He wanted to know how the test worked.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">The test was in 10 days. He couldn’t do anything other than think for all that time. He read extensively into psychological tests on prodigies and all sorts of neuroscience pertaining to his kind. Eventually the day came and his parents dropped him off at the DI8 in their hovering vehicles. He stepped out furtively to look out at the towering, copper-coloured building that loomed over him, and the low hum of his mother’s hovercraft zooming away was the only sound he could hear. The building looked like a massive bee, except with no head or wings, and random mashes of old architecture and intricately repeating patterns with minimalism and modern art - except in a rather beautiful way. It inspired a feeling of ecstasy in James, something he didn’t often feel. His parents drove away reluctantly, still feeling a little confused and uneasy about this whole test thing, but it was James’ choice and he was much smarter than them and they should respect that.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">As he walked towards the structure, it changed colour and texture and appeared completely transparent by the time he reached the front of the building. There was no door, it was just a solid slab. This must be the test, he thought to himself. He placed his hand on the surface of the building, it was cold. And then suddenly it was burning hot and he could feel his hand being scalded and felt the need to pull away with the thought that his hand must have 3rd-degree burns, but no, his hand was fine. He placed his hand on the surface once again. It was cold. It remained cold for a while before again becoming scalding hot. This time he didn’t let go though, he kept his hand glued to the surface. His head jolted forward and banged against the surface. Why did he do that? He wasn’t sure. A couple of seconds later, the now transparent building changed once again and the front fell in to reveal a massive opening resembling a cave. He trudged in and the opening closed behind him. It was dark initially, but his eyes eventually adapted to it. There was a simple desk with a computer on it. It read “DI8 psychoanalysis and classical intelligence test”. James sped right through the test. It started with various highly challenging questions from the International Olympiads in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Linguistics and Informatics and became progressively more difficult, asking approaches to research problems that had been top secret. Once he had completed the test, a box popped up on the screen, turned pinkish-red and said “PASS. CONTINUE TO NEXT ROUND. THIS DESK WILL FALL INTO THE FLOOR IN 3, 2, 1”, and the desk fell right into the electro machined steel floor, leaving it flush once again.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Why that part of the test existed was obvious to him. That was the bit that rooted out prodigies clearly. The next bit however, was far more confusing. A small hole opened up in the ceiling, and out fell a sword. Then multiple holes opened up around the cave structure, and dozens of completely fictional looking monsters came out, made of complex animatronics but with an actual fluid resembling blood. He had to slice up the monsters as soon as possible, one of those monsters actually managed to dig its fangs into James’ leg, and it stung for a few seconds but having eliminated the monster, he noticed that there was no sign there that anything had happened. No wound and no scar. James had once watched a demonstration of the Japanese Kendo, and every action had embedded itself into his mind. He copied those movements effortlessly, ridding the cave of monsters entirely.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">Well, he thought, I suppose that tested the other side of intelligence. How fast can you learn and master kinaesthetic skills? The monsters disappeared into holes in the floor, and the walls of the cave turned white.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">Another table popped out of the floor, this time with a phone and a screen. The screen read “THIS IS THE EMOTIONAL APTITUDE TEST, A CALL TO THE SUICIDE HOTLINE WILL BE REDIRECTED TO THIS PHONE. IT IS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS A SUICIDE HOTLINE OPERATOR. YOUR AGE WILL BE OBFUSCATED BY A VOICE CHANGER” James kept a straight face. This task would strike fear into any old prodigy but not him. He was very much in control of his faculties. He could apply the same technique as with the monsters. He watched a documentary about suicide hotlines once. The operators had a set rulebook, a way to speak to the caller. Active listening, validation, empathy, finding hope. The screen also had some buttons on it, to call an ambulance to the caller’s location, with specific required details, as well as a monitor that showed the heart rate and distress levels of the caller - a function to optimise for. The phone began ringing.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="43">CALLER: “H-hello? Is anyone there”<br>
James: “I’m here. I’m here to listen to you and support you. My name is James. What’s your name?”<br>
CALLER: “I-I’m Alex”<br>
James: “How are you feeling?”<br>
Alex: “I don’t know man. It feels like living in this place is just fucking pointless. It’s like the entire universe is a massive dystopia, there’s nothing left for me here. Maybe it’s just me being a complainer and an asshole, maybe I deserve pain and suffering”<br>
James: “I’m really sorry to hear you’re feeling that way, but I hear you. The world really has gone to dumps, it’s not just you and you don’t deserve pain and suffering. You deserve love and support, and I’m here for you. Please tell me more about your situation.”<br>
Alex: “Well, I used to work as an AI researcher but then the government took my project away from me, I think they’re using it for something awful. That was never my intention in making it man. I tried my best to do good for the world, but fucking hell it backfired on everyone. I’ve fucked over the world and I have no way to sustain myself now either, I’m out of a job and they won’t let me back in”<br>
James: “That sounds awful. Your feelings towards the government are perfectly valid and I understand you man. You must be very bright as an AI researcher, your gifts are valued in this world. The government can be horrid sometimes, and there is no good or bad in science. The moral accountability for your invention is on the government and only the government and I want you to remember that.”<br>
Alex: “I suppose so, but I can’t get the feeling out of my head that I’ve accelerated the downfall of humanity! Fucking hell society was already falling. We have these bullshit neural headsets implanted into us, the government trying to slide its way into our brains one by one! I can’t take it anymore. I hate living in this world. There is only one escape”<br>
James: “You’re right. Again your feelings are totally valid. But think back to happier times, I know the future looks bleak right now. I know you’re out of a job. But think back, what stuff did you do that made you happy?”<br>
Alex: “I always loved reading and writing speculative and dystopian fiction stuff when I was younger. It feels so odd to read it now though, look at how dystopian our world is already? We have super sexualised adverts everywhere, everyone is constantly connected to the internet, nature simply doesn’t exist anymore. The world isn’t how it was when I was 10 years old, enjoying myself in the park. There’s nothing left for me here”<br>
James: “Alex, it really seems like you have a lot to say. You’re insanely smart, and even if your situation isn’t great right now, I have a lot of hope that you’ll be able to clamber out of your hole. You put your thoughts about the world down so passionately, it’s been great listening to you. There is so little authenticity left in this world. Don’t let your passion for writing go to waste, there’s so much you can still do”<br>
Alex: “I suppose you are right. I never really thought about writing about my feelings for this world. It won’t make me much money, but so far I’ve spent the last couple weeks wallowing and feeling sorry for myself. I fucking hate this world, but maybe I should see this life through”<br>
James: “I hope you do man. It’s been really nice for me listening to you talk, I can relate to so much of this. I’m rooting for you dude”<br>
Alex: “Honestly fuck this world, the system is fucked and I’ve tried my best, but I’m not gonna give up yet. I’m a fighter. I will make it out. Thank you so much”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45"><em>CALLER HANGS UP</em></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="48">The screen once again displayed “PASS” and the desk disappeared into the floor.<br>
Whew, piece of cake! His feigning of interest and relatability had worked. People don’t like it when you follow a script trying to make them feel better, but he had problem solved around the script - without understanding an ounce of human nature! James felt good. He had aced the test so far. Proved he was a classical prodigy, a combat artist and a life-saver.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50"><strong>14 years earlier</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="52">Gene editing technology had reached its peak in 2040, and UCL was at the forefront of it. Penelope Wu was fascinated with one particular idea. What if we could mass produce prodigies? The pace of science would go hundreds of times faster if we had a hundred Terence Taos or Newtons. Of course there were lots of ethical considerations that would very much argue against this concept, but Penelope didn’t care about those and neither did her colleagues. She believed she was right, and her research would revolutionise the human race. So she and her colleagues worked for a few years in secret. Her actual research interest was in agriculture and crops, but this was a front. Her colleagues were indispensable too. She hired Anil Roy, a neuroscientist and geneticist! A truly multidisciplinary scientist, with very strong opinions about gene editing and eugenics. She vetted her colleagues subtly yet thoroughly, spending months poking around the topic in conversations. Anil was particularly enthusiastic. By 2044, their technology, Intel-i9 (name courtesy of their hacker) was ready. Now they simply had to test it, although that would perhaps take years to verify. It was in the form of a simple injection. During childbirth all that would need to happen is some of the produced chemical would need to be injected. They didn’t want anyone to know however, apart from the 5 scientists and hackers involved in the programme, so one of the biochemists, David Rodarte, had the idea of mixing it into the standard childbirth injections. They simply had to track where the chemical went and what mother it was given to, and surveil them constantly using the skills of the “ethical” hacker on their team, Dennis Huang.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">“So this is it then”, Penelope said triumphantly to her team. “I suppose we’ll see how this goes, have all of you done your jobs?”. “I’ve inserted the Intel-i9 into samples of the X39 injections shipped across the country, as well as putting little GPS trackers, they must’ve reached the hospital by now” said David the Biochemist. His role at the university gave him access to all of these. “I’m working on tracking the deliveries now, trying to find out who the mothers are”, said Dennis. Anil on the other hand was completely disconnected from the conversation. He had an extremely focussed look on his face as he was studying his team’s research as well as other scientific literature on gene editing that had surfaced. A look of shock came over him. They had successfully targeted the genes that enhanced cognitive abilities yes, but they had, in doing so diminished something very important in a human being. An internal moral compass. They had genetically engineered the prodigious psychopath. He immediately interrupted the meeting to share his discovery. It was at first met with denial from the whole group. “This can’t be!”, Penelope exclaimed, while David just stared into the distance. Penelope told herself to calm down, and rationally thought about Anil’s arguments. There was a serious chance he was right. “On second thought, ABORT”, Penelope exclaimed. “We need to fucking stop those loads, we’ll inform the hospitals that the X39 injections were contaminated or some shit”. “That would cause a major scandal, UCL would lose 80% of its profits”, said David. “FUCK THAT we’ve just invented genetically perfect terrorists, we are screwing over the next generation, profits don’t matter now”, Penelope replied. “No we can solve this without telling the hospitals, we can just get Dennis to hack the traffic and stop the trucks getting there in the first place right?”, asked Anil. “We’ve been hacked”, Dennis announced, defeated. They all stared at him. “I can’t access the GPS anymore, someone’s hacked the network, I won’t know the identities of the mothers!”. They all stared at each other mortified. There was a pin-drop silence in the isolated conference room for a full 20 minutes, while everyone reflected on their actions and the doom they had created. “Okay”, Penelope said, calmer now. “I have a plan, maybe it’s a little farfetched but it’s for the greater good. Just make sure this NEVER LEAVES THIS ROOM”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56"><strong>Back to the present</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">The cave closed off completely. The walls were a white colour, and absolute silence pervaded. James could hear his heartbeat. Nothing new happened in the next 15 minutes. James had waited that long. Maybe the test glitched out? He thought. “Hello? Your test seems to have frozen or something, nothing new has happened!”. It continued this way for another hour. “Oh I get it, they’re trying to see how I react to zero stimuli”. He wasn’t particularly good at this. He had spent most of his life watching something, solving problems, learning, programming. Now he was in an empty white room. Nothing but his thoughts and his irregular heartbeat. A few more hours passed. He made up games to keep his mind occupied. He visualised geometric shapes on the floor and tried to find the angles. He pondered the meaning of this whole test. It’s an interesting psychological experiment, he thought. Maybe it wants to see how prodigies react to empty environments? “I think I know what this test is for”, he stood up and announced to his audience of invisible cameras. “You’re trying to see how prodigies react to emptiness right? Well as you might have been able to tell, I’ve made up my own games to pass the time. I could spend forever here”. Nothing happened for another 2 hours, and James began to wonder if the test was actually frozen or not. Fortunately for him, he began noticing a weird smell. A new smell. It wasn’t there before. Finally a new stimulus! Unfortunately for him, this smell happened to come from a chemical designed to knock people out.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">When he came to, he found himself in a translucent dark box, with his arms strapped with metal strips to a circular turntable. He caught a figure behind the translucent box. It was a woman. Fairly old, like around 70 or so. She introduced herself as Dr. Wu.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">“I suppose it’s time we explain all this, you deserve that much”, she said sadly, although her expressions looked very much rehearsed, as if she’d done this a few times before. “I was involved in a slightly unethical gene-editing experiment, designed to make superhumanly intelligent children 14 years ago. Now we made a slight error that I believe causes these superhumanly intelligent children to be a major existential threat. We couldn’t stop it either, because a very coincidental and rather suspicious hack had prevented us from finding out the identities of the children”. James had already put two and two together. “As you may already be able to tell, you are one of those people. Your date of birth matches up with the week we shipped the injections and we can already tell that you are a prodigy across the cognitive abilities that we programmed in. We also tracked your heart rate and brain signals during the intense emotional tests, and our conclusion is final. I suppose you know what happens now, and understand this is for the greater good of humanity, I am truly sorry for what happens now” “No… wai-”, James protested as a needle poked him in the back and put him to sleep forever. Then a fire lit up and incinerated him.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="63" data-line-end="64">“Who’s next, Dennis?”, Penelope asked matter-of-factly. “Martha Huang, she should be coming in the next 2 hours, we should prepare for the test”. “Send his parents a letter saying he went AWOL just before the test, and make sure the police find nothing of this”, said Penelope to Dennis. “Whatever,” Dennis said. He obeyed and click-clacked on his computer, removing every shred of evidence and redirecting James’ parents’ worried communications to the police to his facility, where he reassured them that the police was making every effort to find their child. He then kept at it for the next 8 executions.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="65" data-line-end="66">He then brought out his plasma gun, shot Penelope in the back and then shot himself in the chest. This would never happen again.</p>
