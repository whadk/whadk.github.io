<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="How_I_want_to_debate_0"></a>How I want to debate</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="5">I need to appreciate the fact that my beliefs about the world are not perfect. In many cases, it’s simply because I lack information. There’s a lot of stuff I don’t know which affects what I believe. It could also be because my critical thinking is flawed in some way or another.<br>
I also want to make one clear distinction which is the difference between opinions and beliefs. Opinions are far more abstract I’d say because they concern matters of morality in many cases, which vary from person to person. You can’t say that one moral stance is necessarily better than another. Beliefs on the other hand are things that can be true or false or, for example in the case of policies, could be proved to be true or false somehow in the future. In this case, I want to specifically talk about debating in the context of beliefs and beliefs about policies. For example, debates like “should we legalise drugs” given that we want society to be at its best. Basically, I don’t want differences in morality - which are completely subjective to play a part. Given this, you would need to share some opinions with the other debater - for example, the opinion that you would want “society to be at its best” or you want “the least number of deaths”. If someone were arguing against you about a policy but they in fact want “the most deaths”, the debate simply wouldn’t work.<br>
I would like my debating to not be focused on winning the debate, but more focused on identifying flaws in my own thinking and learning new information. I want to defend my point to the best of my ability, but I don’t want to purposefully employ tactics that make me seem like I’m winning when I’m actually not. In the sense that, I don’t want to employ fallacies in order to win, and I don’t want to confuse the other person either. This only really works if the other person sees it in the same way, as in not wanting to win but more wanting to learn. I would like the opponent to point out flaws in my argument if they actually exist. I would like the opponent to give me as many facts that support their argument. There is a chance that when I believed what I believed, I didn’t know these facts. These facts may prove integral to understanding the issue at hand better. For example, if we were to take the argument “should we legalise LSD?”, with no knowledge I would say “no we absolutely shouldn’t legalise LSD it is a dangerous drug and it can kill people”. However given some more knowledge, we find out that LSD is non-toxic and non-addictive and it has killed people when they hallucinate and cause harm to themselves. This still doesn’t mean that we should legalise LSD, but it does give me some more information I didn’t have before, which I can use to update my worldview. I could then say “perhaps we should legalise supervised LSD therapy like the one at John Hopkins University?”, and this is what I believe now - although I do need to remain open-minded about this and not wholeheartedly take my belief as gospel. There isn’t enough scientific research on the topic, perhaps doing LSD therapy actually causes brain decay? In that case, should it still be legal? Even if it was legal, should you do it in that case?</p>
